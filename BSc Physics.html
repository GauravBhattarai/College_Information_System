				<p>After the education system came into being in Nepal in 1971 (2028 B.S.), all the higher education centers scattered all over the country were unified under the umbrella of Tribhuvan University. Subsequently, Institute of Applied Science and Technology (IASTEC) was established in 1973 in Dharan, which became the forerunner of Food Technology program in Nepal. This was the turning point of Food Technology education in Nepal. The objectives carried by the institute during its establishment may not have great relevance at this point because the institute was mutilated at an embryonic stage. At present, programs of diverse natures are being run in this Central Campus of Technology. Hence it would be appropriate to state the objectives carried by each program.</p>

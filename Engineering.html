					<p>Institute of Engineering (IoE) or (commonly known as Pulchowk IoE) was founded in 1930 as the first technical school of Nepal.<br>

					The school, after its inception, began course on textile skill. Engineering was introduced in the school later in 1942 offering two-year sub-overseer courses for SLC (now SEE) graduates. This school was moved to Tri-chandra campus in 1945 and renamed as engineering school in 1950. The school was recognized as a formal institution for engineering education in 1958. It was then renamed as Nepal Engineering Institute and was shifted to Nepal Administrative Training Council complex, Jawalakhel, Lalitpur in early 1958. By the end of 1958, it was taken to Ananda Niketan, Pulchowk. It, then, offered overseer course in civil engineering and later in 1971, the institute started electrical overseer programs.<br>

					In 1963, a technical training institute was established in Thapathali under the assistance of German Government. The training institute offered courses on overseer in mechanical and electrical engineering.<br>

					After the introduction of New Education System Plan in 1972, the government formed Institute of Engineering (IoE) and brought the organ under the Tribhuvan University. Both Nepal Engineering Institute and Technical Training Institute were then inducted under IoE. Nepal Engineering Institute was renamed as Pulchowk Campus and Technical Training Institute was renamed as Thapathali Campus.<br>

					IoE runs professional diplomas, undergraduate, postgraduate and Ph.D. programs and as well as low and tertiary level technicians. The IoE is ranked 8429 in the world and is the fourth best educational institution of Nepal. The institute is the top second engineering institutes of the country.<br>
					The IoE has four constituent and ten affiliated campuses in the country.<br>

Initially established as a private campus, NCC used to run two programs, namely: Intermediate of Commerce (I.Com) and Bachelors of Commerce (B.Com) in its earlier days.

				When the college was first conceived in 2021 BS, it had to overcome several of the obstacles faced by Non Governmental Organization (NGO) colleges authorized from TU. Since it did not have its own building, the college used to run its courses from Patan High School without impeding school activities with only two full time faculties. From that time forward, the number of teachers has increased, and since the enactment of the National Education Module on the high education system, Nepal Commerce Campus began industry, administration, commerce and public administration programs under the name of Patan Campus. In association with the academics of commerce stream, the college today covers the study of markets, commerce, and public administration. Over the past twelve years, it has been successfully running Bachelors in Business Administration program of TU, and the positive accomplishments are apparently reflected by the test results. The achievements have been the consequences of the contribution made by the leading team of faculty members, academicians, and scholars.<br>
